\title{sim_R1.R}
\usage{
sim_R1(n, muVec, sigMat, bounds)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of simulations.}

\item{muVec}{Mean vector of MVN (under the alternative).}

\item{sigMat}{Covariance matrix of MVN (under the alternative).}

\item{bounds}{A d*1 vector of bounds on the magnitudes of the test statistics, where
the first element is the bound for |Z|_(1) and the last element is the bound for |Z|_(d).
If provided, will calculate power from crossing the bounds.}
}
\value{
Lower bound on the probability.
}
\description{
Simulate the lower bound R1.

myVariance <- matrix(data=0.3, nrow=5, ncol=5)
